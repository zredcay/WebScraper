Simple web scraper that utilizes requests and bs4. This project reads urls from a .txt file and a generic header to make a HTTP Request. This returns the html information from the link which is passed to the Beautiful Soup Object. Using this soup object specfic components about the webpage are found, written to an output csv, and printed to the terminal. Other data can be added following the same process. The urls used can be added or removed as needed.
